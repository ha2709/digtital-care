## **How ​​do you run the project?**

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash

```

Here's the **core logic flow** for the online healthcare platform based on your presentation:

---

## **Core Logic Flow**

### **A. Patient Journey**
1. **Registration/Login**  
   - Signup with email/phone + OTP verification  
   - Profile creation (medical history, allergies, etc.)  

2. **Book Consultation**  
   - Search doctors by specialty/availability  
   - Select slot → Confirm appointment → Payment  

3. **Consultation**  
   - Video/chat interface with doctor  
   - Real-time prescription generation (e-prescription)  

4. **Post-Consultation**  
   - Order medicines (linked to pharmacy)  
   - Book lab tests (if prescribed)  
   - Access health records  

---

### **B. Doctor Workflow**  
1. **Onboarding**  
   - Verification (medical license, ID proof)  
   - Set availability/slots  

2. **Consultation**  
   - Accept/reject appointment requests  
   - Access patient history pre-consultation  
   - Generate e-prescription (auto-saved to patient profile)  

3. **Post-Consultation**  
   - Receive payment (split between platform/doctor)  
   - Refer to labs/pharmacies if needed  

---

### **C. Pharmacy Integration**  
1. **Order Processing**  
   - Receive e-prescription from patient/doctor  
   - Check medicine availability  
   - Confirm order → dispatch/delivery tracking  

2. **Inventory Sync**  
   - Auto-update stock when order is placed  
   - Low-stock alerts  

---

### **D. Diagnostic Lab Flow**  
1. **Test Booking**  
   - Patient selects test → chooses lab → pays  
   - Home collection or lab visit option  

2. **Results Delivery**  
   - Upload reports to patient dashboard  
   - Share with doctor (if linked to consultation)  

---

## **Critical System Interactions**
| **Action**               | **Backend Logic**                                  | **API Calls**                          |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Patient books appointment | Check doctor availability → confirm slot → deduct payment | Calendar API + Payment Gateway         |
| Doctor writes e-prescription | Save to patient profile → notify pharmacy | Database CRUD + Notification Service   |
| Pharmacy processes order | Validate prescription → check stock → confirm order | Inventory API + Delivery Service       |

---

## **Key Technical Logic**
1. **Real-time Notifications**  
   - Websockets for appointment alerts/medicine status  
2. **Data Security**  
   - Encrypt health records (AES-256)  
   - Role-based access (patients/doctors see only relevant data)  
3. **Payment Handling**  
   - Split payments (platform commission + doctor/pharmacy payout)  
4. **Emergency Override**  
   - Priority booking for critical cases  

---

## **Edge Cases to Handle**
- Doctor cancellation → auto-refund + patient notification  
- Prescription expiry (e.g., 30-day validity for medicines)  
- Lab test rescheduling (if sample collection fails)
